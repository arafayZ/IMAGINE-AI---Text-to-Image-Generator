# IMAGINE-AI---Text-to-Image-Generator

ImagineAI: Text-to-Image Generator
ImagineAI is an advanced AI-powered image generation tool that transforms textual descriptions into high-quality, realistic visual art. Built on the Stable Diffusion XL (SSD-1B) architecture, it provides a seamless interface for creators and designers to visualize their ideas without needing complex programming or expensive hardware.

#🌟 Key Features
1. High-Resolution Generation: Leverages the Stable Diffusion XL pipeline to create detailed and aesthetically pleasing images.
2. User-Friendly Interface: Powered by Gradio, offering a clean web-based UI with sliders for real-time adjustments.
3. Hardware Optimization: Includes built-in memory management (gc.collect and torch.cuda.empty_cache) and attention slicing to ensure stability on both CPU and GPU (T4) environments.
4. Customizable Parameters:
  1. Inference Steps: Fine-tune the balance between speed and image quality.
  2. Guidance Scale: Control how strictly the AI follows your textual prompt.
  3. Negative Prompts: Hardcoded safety filters to prevent distortions, watermarks, and anatomical errors.
  4. Resolution Control: Adjustable height and width settings for different aspect ratios.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
1. Language: Python
2. Deep Learning: PyTorch, HuggingFace Diffusers
3. Model: Stable Diffusion XL (segmind/SSD-1B)
4. Frontend: Gradio
5. Environment: Google Colab / CUDA-enabled systems
(Note: This project's output is actually displayed on a Gradio Web UI)

#🚀 How to Run on Google Colab
1. Open Colab: Go to Google Colab.
2. Change Runtime: Navigate to Runtime -> Change runtime type and select T4 GPU.
3. Install Dependencies:

📝 Implementation Details
The project utilizes Attention Slicing and xformers to reduce VRAM usage, allowing high-resolution generation even on 8GB-16GB GPUs. Every generation cycle is followed by a memory flush to prevent OutOfMemory errors during long-running sessions.
